                        <h3>Benford's Law</h3>
                        <p><em>Benford's law</em>, also known as the Newcomb-Benford law, 
                        the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation 
                        that in many real-life sets of numerical data, the leading digit is 
                        likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as 
                        the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as 
                        the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. </p>
